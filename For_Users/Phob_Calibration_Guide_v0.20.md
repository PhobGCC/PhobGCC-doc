**THIS IS LEGACY FIRMWARE! PLEASE UPDATE TO THE [LATEST!](/For_Users/Phob_Calibration_Guide_v0.28.md)**

**NOTE: This is for firmware version 0.20.**

For later development versions of the software that have not yet been released, search for “Current Commands List” in the PhobGCC.ino file to see the commands for that version as they may have changed.

**NOTE 2: The controller starts in safe mode! To make any changes you must disable it first!**

I strongly recommend using Smashscope (either on a Wii or Dolphin) for all of this.
An alternative is Uncle Punch Training Mode 3.0. In the Training Lab menu, under General enable “Input Display”, and under Info Display enable “System LStick”, “System CStick”, and “System Trigger” as the first three rows.

# Activating the Analog Sticks - B

* After plugging in the controller, press B to activate the analog sticks.
* If you are playing using Dolphin/Slippi, YOU MUST POWER CYCLE (unplug and plug back in) YOUR CONTROLLER EVERY TIME BEFORE YOU START SMASH, then press B once smash is running.
  * If you are using a Mayflash adapter, you must plug in both USB connectors for the controller to register in Dolphin/Slippi.
* If you do not do this your calibration may be off and you may not get 1.0 dashes.

# Making Changes On PhobGCC

* Every time you give the PhobGCC a command, except for during the stick calibration process, the analog and c-stick will freeze pointing to the top right for 2 seconds.
* If you're in game without input visualization tools, you will see your character roll to the right to indicate this, or you'll see the menu tilt due to the C-stick.

# Safe Mode Toggle - AXY+Start

* This is necessary to be able to make any changes on the controller, otherwise it won’t let you change any settings.
* When you turn Safe Mode off (configuration is possible), the controller freezes for 2 seconds.
* When you turn Safe Mode back on (you can no longer configure), the controller freezes for 4 seconds to distinguish. You can also just unplug and plug the controller back in to ensure that you are in Safe Mode.

# Controller Reset - ABZ+Start

* **Use this if you have uploaded code to the controller for the first time, are upgrading from an older software version, or have messed up your settings in some way.**
* This will reset all the controller settings, including snapback filtering, analog delay, offsets, and calibrations.
* These default values will not be good, you **will need to calibrate and adjust snapback!**

# Analog Stick Calibration - AXY+L

[PhobGCC Notch Calibration Guide - YouTube](https://youtu.be/hscmtzy7dqs)

* Stick calibration has two phases: measurement and notch adjustment.
* If you’ve already calibrated the stick and just want to adjust notches, you can skip the measurement phase and immediately begin notch adjustment by pressing Start at any time during the measurement phase.

## Measurement Phase

* During the measurement phase, the C-stick will alternate between center and positions along the rim. First it will have you measure the cardinal directions (right, up, left down), then the 45 degree diagonals, then it will allow you to measure one notch in each eighth segment of the circle.
* To measure, move the stick to the indicated notch, then press either L or R to go to the next step.
  * When measuring, move the Analog Stick into the notch in the same way you would during gameplay. For cardinals, move straight from center. For the lower 45 degree diagonals, slide down from horizontal to mimic the shield drop motion.
* If you think you messed up a measurement (measured the wrong notch, for example), you can go back to the previous notch measurement by pressing Z while the C-Stick is centered. Press multiple times to go back more steps.
* Measuring tertiary notches between the cardinals and 45 degree notches is optional. If you don’t have a notch where the C-stick is indicating, simply leave the Analog Stick centered.

## Notch Adjustment Phase

* During the notch adjustment phase, the C-stick will indicate along the rim which notch is currently being adjusted. Only notches that were measured may be adjusted. Any notches that were not measured will be automatically skipped.
* The C-stick’s displayed value will be exactly the notch position that was measured during the measurement phase.
* If the Analog Stick was uncalibrated and outputting gibberish values before, it should now be behaving normally. It gives you a live preview of how the stick will behave based on the current notch adjustment settings.
* To adjust the notch that the C-Stick is pointing towards, press X to shift the notch clockwise and Y to shift the notch counterclockwise. Make sure you check how your notches behave as the stick enters from different directions.
* Reset the current back to the originally measured position by pressing B.
* When you’re done adjusting the current notch, press either L or R to go to the next notch. Press Z to go back to the previous notch, but you cannot go back to the measurement phase.
* When the C-stick’s output returns to center (and you can move it), your stick is now calibrated.

# C-Stick Calibration - AXY+R

This process is exactly like Analog Stick Calibration, but instead, the Analog Stick moves to show you how to move the C-Stick.

# Analog Stick Snapback Adjustment - LX/LY + Du/Dd

The Analog Stick Snapback Filter adjustment doesn’t affect responsiveness of the stick when moving away from the center. Increasing the value of this filter only makes it return to center more slowly.

* Press L + Your Axis (X/Y) + To increase or decrease strength (D-pad Up/D-pad Down)
  * Example: LX+Du suppresses X-axis snapback more, LY+Dd suppresses Y-axis snapback less.
* The scale goes from 0-6, where newer sticks need a setting of 0-1 on each axis while worn ones need 2-3. 3+ is for special situations such as metal stick caps or lighter spring weights.
* Press L+Start+D-pad Down to see the current values on each axis of the Analog Stick.

# Analog Stick Axis Delay Adjustment

The Analog Stick Axis Delay is just a simple low-pass filter similar to a capacitor on a vanilla Gamecube controller. Increasing this setting slightly reduces responsiveness.

* Press L + (A/B) + To increase or decrease (D-pad Up/D-pad Down)
  * A corresponds to the X axis, B corresponds to the Y axis.
  * Example: LA+Du increases the X-axis Delay, LB+Dd decreases the Y-axis delay.
* The scale goes from 0-9.
  * Single-Motion Ledgedashing: ~5 on X-axis and 0 on Y-axis
* Press L+Start+Dpad Down to see the current values on each axis of the C-stick.

# C-Stick Snapback Adjustment

The C-Stick Snapback Filter is actually a low-pass filter similar to the Analog Stick Axis Delay that has dual purposes, for reducing the chance of getting the wrong move and for suppressing snapback.

* Press R + Your Axis (X/Y) + To increase or decrease (D-pad Up/D-pad Down)
  * Example: RX+Du is increasing the X-axis Snapback, RY+Dd is decreasing the Y-axis snapback.
* The scale goes from 0-9.
* To reduce the chance of getting the wrong move, increase the value on the axis that you don’t want, and decrease the value on the axis you do want.
* To suppress snapback on an axis, use a somewhat high value here (start with 7).
* Press R+Start+D-pad Down to see the current values on each axis of the Analog Stick.

# C-Stick Offset

* Press R + (A/B) + To increase or decrease (D-pad Up/D-pad Down)
  * A corresponds to the X-axis, B corresponds to the Y-axis.
  * Example: LA+Du is increasing the C-stick X Offset, LB+Dd is decreasing the C-stick Y Offset.
* This shifts the global coordinate C-stick coordinate, not delay. This is for hitting downward angled forward smashes, for example.
* Press R+Start+D-pad Down to see the current values on each axis of the C-stick.

# Z-Jump

* Press XZ+Start to swap X and Z. This will reset Y if previously swapped.
* Press YZ+Start to swap Y and Z. This will reset X if previously swapped.
* Press AXY+Z to reset to the default.

# Analog Trigger Modes

* Press ZL+Start to cycle through the trigger modes for L-trigger.
* Press ZR+Start to cycle through the trigger modes for R-trigger.
* There are 3 trigger modes:
  * Mode 1: Standard behavior with the analog slider active and a digital press at the bottom of the travel. Smashscope will show red bars and then turn blue on digital press
  * Mode 2: Digital-only, where the analog slider is disabled. Smashscope will show nothing.
  * Mode 3: Analog-only, where the digital press is disabled. You will still get LRA+Start in this mode. Smashscope will show only red bars.
