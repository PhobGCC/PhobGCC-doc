# PhobGCC Version 2.0.5 Elecrow Ordering Guide

Once you've extracted the files from the .zip, you should have three files. The Phob2 gerbers, the Elecrow BOM, and the Elecrow INFO zip.

Head over to the [PCB assembly ordering page](https://www.elecrow.com/pcb-assembly.html) and fill it out as follows:

**NOTE: Set your PCBA quantity, country, and preferred shipping option**

Once your settings match the image above, you then upload the BOM spreadsheet where it asks, followed by uploading the INFO zip where it asks you to "Upload Other Files".
Scrolling further down you upload the gerbers.

Once that's set, you configure the PCB settings as follows:

**NOTE: Your PCB quantity must match your PCBA quantity, otherwise you may end up with blank boards. You must also select immersion gold coating (ENIG)**
